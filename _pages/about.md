I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the <a href='https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml'>  Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML)</a>, <a href='https://www.adelaide.edu.au/'> University of Adelaide </a>, supervised by <a href='https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~javen/'> Prof. Javen Qinfeng Shi, <a href='https://zzhang.org/'> Dr. Zhen Zhang</a> and <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/yuhangliu/homepage'> Dr. Yuhang Liu</a>. My research primarily delves into the intersection of causality and machine learning, with a focus on causal representation learning, domain-adaptive models, and causal generative modeling.

Before commencing my PhD, I accumulated four years of industry experience at <a href='https://www.huawei.com/en/corporate-information'>Huawei</a>, <a href='https://www.tellhow.com/en/index.html'>TellHow</a>, and <a href='https://www.chengshizhiguang.com/'>Autocity (Shenzhen)</a>, with a primary focus on computer vision applications. Prior to this, I obtained my M.S. in Engineering and B.Eng. degrees from <a href='http://english.whut.edu.cn/'>Wuhan University of Technology</a>. During my Master's program, I spent half a year as a visiting student at California PATH, UC Berkeley, focusing on perception research in autonomous driving.

I am a proactive and dedicated researcher, committed to applying my expertise gained from both academic training and practical industrial experience to advance technology for the greater good of society.
