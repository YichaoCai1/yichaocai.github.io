> It seems fate err’d with a red string’s tie,
> Meant for others, yet you and I did align.
> Destined paths not to cross, we sail by,
> Yet why do I drift towards your sign?
> 
> A sudden affection quietly blooms,
> And I, merely a passerby in stride,
> From afar, your faint fragrance looms,
> Yet dare not approach you to confide.
> 
> Perhaps, such is the visage of life’s way,
> My own harbor, long destined, beckons still.
> This love, in my heart, must hidden stay,
> Leaving warmth missed, and joy unspilled.
