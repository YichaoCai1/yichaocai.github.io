<center>It seems fate err’d with a red string’s tie,</center> 
<center> Meant for others, yet you and I did align.</center> 
<center> Destined paths not to cross, we sail by,</center> 
<center> Yet why do I drift towards your sign?</center> 
<br /> 
<center> A sudden affection quietly blooms,</center> 
<center> And I, merely a passerby in stride,</center> 
<center> From afar, your faint fragrance looms,</center> 
<center> Yet dare not approach you to confide.</center> 
<br />
<center> Perhaps, such is the visage of life’s way,</center> 
<center> My own harbor, long destined, beckons still.</center> 
<center> This love, in my heart, must hidden stay,</center> 
<center> Leaving warmth missed, and joy unspilled.</center>
