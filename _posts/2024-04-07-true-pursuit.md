<center> In the rush of life, I chase dreams yet to gleam:</center> 
<center> Dedicated to research, where wonders beam;</center> 
<center> Wishing my name will shine, in the hall of fame;</center> 
<center> In eyes that see my worth, my spirit’s esteemed.</center> 
<br /> 
<center> But if fate whispers, leading me to you,</center> 
<center> To a quiet town, where sunrise paints the hue.</center> 
<center> I’d choose a simple life, in morning’s dew,</center> 
<center> In a humble home, where love grows true.</center> 
<br />
<center> Whichever path you wish, I’ll walk it, too.</center> 
<center> Beside you, I’ll unravel life’s complex maze,</center> 
<center> Crafting each moment into a warm blaze.</center> 
<center> In mundane joys, our connection finds its muse.</center> 
<br />
<center> This pursuit, my heart’s honest revelation,</center> 
<center> In love, finding life’s truest foundation.</center> 
<center> With you, through each day’s gentle rotation,</center> 
<center> Till time’s end, in your embrace, my final destination.</center>
